Hi, my name is Sara. After many years out of the tech industry, I have decided to make my way back through free/cheap and trusted resources. The future is just around the corner and for me to stay relevant, have a living income, and have the life I desire, growing my mind and my skills is the only way I am going to get there.

So welcome to my little corner of the world as I push what I currently am now.

Here is to the future,
Sara
