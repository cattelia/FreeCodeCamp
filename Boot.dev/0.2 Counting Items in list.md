# Assignment 1: COUNTING THE ITEMS IN A LIST

Remember that we can iterate over all the elements in a list using a loop. For example, the following code will print each item in the sports list.

```python
for i in range(0, len(sports)):
    print(sports[i])
```

## ASSIGNMENT

Our players need a way to see how many copies of a specific item they have within their inventory!

Let's finish the get_item_counts function. Within the loop, check if the items are a Potion, Bread, or Shortsword, then add up how many there are of each by incrementing the potion_count, bread_count and shortsword_count variables respectively.

### TIP

// The example shows you how to access the values in a list. Combine this with what you know about comparison and assignment operators to complete the assignment.

# Assignment 2: FIND AN ITEM IN A LIST

Example of "no-index" or "no-range" syntax:

```python
for fruit in fruits:
print(fruit)
```

## ASSIGNMENT

We need to check if a player has a specific item in their inventory. In the contains_leather_scraps function, use the no-index syntax to iterate over each item in items. If you find an item called Leather Scraps, set the found variable to True.

# Assignment 3: FIND THE INCREASE

## ASSIGNMENT

We keep track of each character's level in a list. When someone levels up, we want to know about it so we can congratulate them! Your assignment is to compare the `old_character_levels` and `new_character_levels` lists and to print the index where a character's level increased.

The existing code in the loop you've been given loops over all of the indexes in `old_character_levels`. Because `old_character_levels` and `new_character_levels` are the same lengths, you can reuse `i` to index into both.

Fill in the loop with code that prints the indexes where the item in the first list is less than the item in the second list. For example, if the lists are:

```python
old_character_levels = [2, 5, 3, 7, 5]
new_character_levels = [1, 5, 19, 7, 8]
```

Then your code should print these indexes:

```python
2
4
```

# Assignment 4: FIND MAX

## INFINITY

The built-in float() function can create a numeric floating point value of negative infinity. Because _every value_ will be greater than negative infinity, we can use it to help us accomplish our goal of finding the max value. I've added it for you as the starting value of `max_so_far`.

```python
negative_infinity = float('-inf')
positive_infinity = float('inf')
```

## ASSIGNMENT

Our players want a way to see their strongest attack from their last combat. Let's add another function to analyze data from our combat log.

Complete the `find_max` function that looks at each number in the `nums` list and returns the maximum value. If no maximum is found, it just returns negative infinity.

### Example

```python
find_max([100, 10, 22])
# returns 100
```

# Assignment 5: MODULO OPERATOR IN PYTHON

## THE MODULO OPERATOR CAN BE USED TO FIND A REMAINDER:

For example, `7 % 2` would be `1`, because 2 can be multiplied evenly into 7 at most 3 times:

```python
2 * 3 = 6
```

Then there is 1 remaining to get from `6` to `7`.

```python
7 - 6 = 1
```

The modulo operator is the percent sign: %. It's important to recognize modulo is not a percentage though! That's just the symbol we're using.

```python
remainder = 8 % 3
# remainder = 2
```

An odd number is a number that when divided by `2`, the remainder is not `0`.

## ASSIGNMENT

Inside the loop in the `get_odd_numbers` function, use the modulo operator to check if each number, i, is odd. If a number is odd, append it to the `odd_numbers` list.

# Assignment 6: SLICING LISTS

Python makes it easy to slice and dice lists to work only with the section you care about. One way to do this is to use the simple slicing operator, which is just a colon `:`.

With this operator, you can specify where to start and end the slice, and how to step through the original. List slicing returns a new list from the existing list.

The syntax is as follows:

```python
my_list[ start : stop : step ]
```

For example:

```python
scores = [50, 70, 30, 20, 90, 10, 50]
# Display list
print(scores[1:5:2])
# Prints [70, 20]
```

The above reads as "give me a slice of the `scores` list from index 1, up to but not including 5, skipping every 2nd value. _All of the sections are optional._

## OMITTING SECTIONS

You can also omit various sections ("start", "stop", or "step"). For example, `numbers[:3]` means "get all items from the start up to (but not including) index 3". `numbers[3:]` means "get all items from index 3 to the end".

```python
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
numbers[:3] # Gives [0, 1, 2]
numbers[3:] # Gives [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

## USING ONLY THE "STEP" SECTION

```python
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
numbers[::2] # Gives [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
```

## NEGATIVE INDICES

Negative indices count from the end of the list. For example, `numbers[-1]` gives the last item in the list, `numbers[-2]` gives the second last item, and so on.

```python
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
numbers[-3:] # Gives [7, 8, 9]
```

## ASSIGNMENT

Complete the given `get_champion_slices` function. It takes a list of `champions` and should return three new lists based on the given champions:

1. First, return a slice of the `champions` list that starts with the third champion and goes to the end of the list.
2. Next, return a slice of the `champions` list that starts at the beginning of the list and ends with the third champion from the end (inclusive).
3. Last, return a slice of the `champions` list that only includes the champions in even numbered indexes.

### TIP

// Remember, you can return multiple values from a function by separating them with commas:

```python
return value1, value2, value3
```

# Assignment 7: LIST OPERATIONS - CONCATENATE

Concatenating two lists (smushing them together) is easy in Python, just use the `+` operator.

```python
total = [1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6]
print(total)
# Prints: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

## ASSIGNMENT

Fantasy Quest allows users to keep lists of their favorite items. Your job is to finish the `concatenate_favorites function`. It takes three different parameters - the player's `favorite_weapons`, `favorite_armor` and `favorite_items`.

1. Create a new list that combines `favorite_weapons`, `favorite_armor`, and `favorite_items` in this order.
2. Return the list containing the combined favorites.

# Assignment 8: LIST OPERATIONS - CONTAINS

Checking whether a value exists in a list is also really easy in Python, just use the `in` keyword.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]
print("banana" in fruits)
# Prints: True
```

## ASSIGNMENT

Our players have requested an in-game feature that will allow them to type in a weapon name to check if it's in the list of top weapons in the realm.

Complete the `is_top_weapon` function. It should return `True` if the weapon is in the `top_weapons` list, otherwise it should return `False`.

# Assignment 9: LIST DELETION

Python has a built-in keyword <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#the-del-statement">del</a> that deletes items from objects. In the case of a list, you can delete specific indexes or entire slices.

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# delete the fourth item
del nums[3]
print(nums)
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# delete the second item up to (but not including) the fourth item
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
del nums[1:3]
print(nums)
# Output: [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# delete all elements
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
del nums[:]
print(nums)
# Output: []
```

## ASSIGNMENT

In Fantasy Quest there is a list of strongholds on the map that players can visit to defeat powerful bosses. Let's update the `trim_strongholds` function to:

1. Delete the first stronghold from the list
2. Delete the last two strongholds from the list
3. Return the new trimmed-down list

# Assignment 10: TUPLES

Tuples are collections of data that are ordered and unchangeable. You can think of a tuple as a `List` with a fixed size. Tuples are created with round brackets:

```python
my_tuple = ("this is a tuple", 45, True)
print(my_tuple[0])
# this is a tuple
print(my_tuple[1])
# 45
print(my_tuple[2])
# True
```

While it's typically considered bad practice to store items of different types in a List it's not a problem with Tuples. Because they have a fixed size, it's easy to keep track of which indexes store which types of data.

Tuples are often used to store very small groups (like 2 or 3 items) of data. For example, you might use a tuple to store a dog's name and age.

```python
dog = ("Fido", 4)
```

_Note: There is a special case for creating single-item tuples. You must include a comma so Python knows it's a tuple and not regular parentheses._

```python
dog = ("Fido",)
```

Because Tuples hold their data, multiple tuples can be stored within a list. Similar to storing other data in lists, each tuple within the list is separated by a comma. When accessing tuples the first index relates to which tuple you want to access, the second relates to the values within that tuple.

```python
my_tuples = [("this is the first tuple in the list", 45, True),
("this is the second tuple in the list", 21, False)]

print(my_tuples[0][0]) # this is the first tuple in the list
print(my_tuples[0][1]) # 45
print(my_tuples[1][0]) # this is the second tuple in the list
print(my_tuples[1][2]) # False
```

## ASSIGNMENT

The "Fantasy Quest" character system needs a list of "heroes" to be able to run the game properly. Someone wrote some pretty nasty code, and the code in question creates a `heroes` list where every 3rd index defines a new hero. First their name, then their age, then whether or not they're an "elf".

Change the heroes list declaration from its current state to a list of tuples. Use the same data for each hero, and order it in the same way.
