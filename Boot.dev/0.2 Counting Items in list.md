# Assignment 1: COUNTING THE ITEMS IN A LIST

Remember that we can iterate over all the elements in a list using a loop. For example, the following code will print each item in the sports list.

```
for i in range(0, len(sports)):
    print(sports[i])
```

## ASSIGNMENT

Our players need a way to see how many copies of a specific item they have within their inventory!

Let's finish the get_item_counts function. Within the loop, check if the items are a Potion, Bread, or Shortsword, then add up how many there are of each by incrementing the potion_count, bread_count and shortsword_count variables respectively.

### TIP

// The example shows you how to access the values in a list. Combine this with what you know about comparison and assignment operators to complete the assignment.

# Assignment 2: FIND AN ITEM IN A LIST

Example of "no-index" or "no-range" syntax:

```
for fruit in fruits:
print(fruit)
```

## ASSIGNMENT

We need to check if a player has a specific item in their inventory. In the contains_leather_scraps function, use the no-index syntax to iterate over each item in items. If you find an item called Leather Scraps, set the found variable to True.

# Assignment 3: FIND THE INCREASE

## ASSIGNMENT

We keep track of each character's level in a list. When someone levels up, we want to know about it so we can congratulate them! Your assignment is to compare the `old_character_levels` and `new_character_levels` lists and to print the index where a character's level increased.

The existing code in the loop you've been given loops over all of the indexes in `old_character_levels`. Because `old_character_levels` and `new_character_levels` are the same lengths, you can reuse `i` to index into both.

Fill in the loop with code that prints the indexes where the item in the first list is less than the item in the second list. For example, if the lists are:

```
old_character_levels = [2, 5, 3, 7, 5]
new_character_levels = [1, 5, 19, 7, 8]
```

Then your code should print these indexes:

```
2
4
```

# Assignment 4: FIND MAX

## INFINITY

The built-in float() function can create a numeric floating point value of negative infinity. Because _every value_ will be greater than negative infinity, we can use it to help us accomplish our goal of finding the max value. I've added it for you as the starting value of `max_so_far`.

```
negative_infinity = float('-inf')
positive_infinity = float('inf')
```

## ASSIGNMENT

Our players want a way to see their strongest attack from their last combat. Let's add another function to analyze data from our combat log.

Complete the `find_max` function that looks at each number in the `nums` list and returns the maximum value. If no maximum is found, it just returns negative infinity.

### Example

```
find_max([100, 10, 22])
# returns 100
```

# Assignment 5: MODULO OPERATOR IN PYTHON

## THE MODULO OPERATOR CAN BE USED TO FIND A REMAINDER:

For example, `7 % 2` would be `1`, because 2 can be multiplied evenly into 7 at most 3 times:

```
2 * 3 = 6
```

Then there is 1 remaining to get from `6` to `7`.

```
7 - 6 = 1
```

The modulo operator is the percent sign: %. It's important to recognize modulo is not a percentage though! That's just the symbol we're using.

```
remainder = 8 % 3
# remainder = 2
```

An odd number is a number that when divided by `2`, the remainder is not `0`.

## ASSIGNMENT

Inside the loop in the `get_odd_numbers` function, use the modulo operator to check if each number, i, is odd. If a number is odd, append it to the `odd_numbers` list.
