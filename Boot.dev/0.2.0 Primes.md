# <span style="color:#0F77A5"><strong>PRIME & MODULOS</strong></span>

A math student is working on a project and needs an easy way to determine whether or not a number is prime. She asked you to write a program to help her.

## CHALLENGE

Write a function that takes a single number as input and returns `True` if it is a prime number or `False` if it is not.

## WHAT IS A PRIME NUMBER?

A prime number is a positive integer, greater than 1, that is only divisible by itself and 1. For example, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are all prime numbers, but 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9 are not.

## TIP

// 0 and 1 are not prime numbers! And don't forget to catch all negative numbers!

// We'll talk more about it next chapter, but you can use the modulo operator `%` to find a remainder. For example, `7 % 2` would be `1`, because 2 can be multiplied evenly into 7 at most 3 times.

```python
remainder = 8 % 3
# remainder = 2
```

```python
remainder = 9 % 3
# remainder = 0
```

# <span style="color:#ECAD35">Solution</span>

_I'm really proud of it. :]_

```python
def is_prime(number):
    # Positive number and is Greater than 1
    if number <= 1:
        return False
    # Make a list of the remainder calculated from 1 - 9 divisors
    multiplier_count = [(number % i) for i in range(1, number + 1)]

    # If the list Comprehensions has more than 2 "0's" it means that
    #    the number is not Prime

    return False if multiplier_count.count(0) > 2 else True
```
