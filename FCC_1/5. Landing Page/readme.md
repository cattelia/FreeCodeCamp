# Objective: Build a Product Landing Page

### Build an app that is functionally similar to https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks.

<strong>User Stories:</strong>

1. Your product landing page should have a `header` element with a corresponding `id="header"`
2. You can see an image within the `header` element with a corresponding `id="header-img"` (A logo would make a good image here)
3. Within the `#header` element, you can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar"
4. You can see at least three clickable elements inside the `nav` element, each with the class `nav-link`
5. When you click a `.nav-link` button in the `nav` element, you are taken to the corresponding section of the landing page
6. You can watch an embedded product video with `id="video"`
7. Your landing page has a `form` element with a corresponding `id="form"`
8. Within the `form`, there is an input field with `id="email"` where you can enter an email address
9. The `#email` input field should have placeholder text to let users know what the field is for
10. The `#email` input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address
11. Within the form, there is a submit `input` with a corresponding `id="submit"`
12. When you click the `#submit` element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: `https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit`)
13. The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport
14. Your product landing page should have at least one media query
15. Your product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once

_Note: Be sure to add <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> in your HTML to link your stylesheet and apply your CSS_
