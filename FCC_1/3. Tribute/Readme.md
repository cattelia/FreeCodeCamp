# Objective:

### Build an app that is functionally similar to https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks. Do not copy this demo project.

<strong>User Stories:</strong>

1. <input type="checkbox"> Your tribute page should have a `main` element with a corresponding `id` of `main`, which contains all other elements
2. <input type="checkbox"> You should see an element with an `id` of `title`, which contains a string (i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page _(e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug")_
3. <input type="checkbox"> You should see either a `figure` or a `div` element with an `id` of `img-div`
4. <input type="checkbox"> Within the `#img-div` element, you should see an `img` element with a corresponding `id="image"`
5. <input type="checkbox"> Within the `#img-div` element, you should see an element with a corresponding `id="img-caption"` that contains textual content describing the image shown in `#img-div`
6. <input type="checkbox"> You should see an element with a corresponding `id="tribute-info"`, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page
7. <input type="checkbox"> You should see an `a` element with a corresponding `id="tribute-link"`, which links to an outside site, that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. <strong>HINT:</strong> You must give your element an attribute of `target` and set it to `_blank` in order for your link to open in a new tab
8. <input type="checkbox"> Your `#image` should use `max-width` and `height` properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size
9. <input type="checkbox"> Your `img` element should be centered within its parent element

_Note: Be sure to add <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> in your HTML to link your stylesheet and apply your CSS_
