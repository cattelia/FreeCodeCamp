Matplotlib is a first class citizen in Jupyter Notebooks
    hat you can just input Matplotlib commands directly into Jupyter without any other setup

Numpy is an advanced numeric computation and processing Python library

    What are Numbers?
    A computer can only process 1s and 0s - bits. 
    Your memory, RAM, is the central place where your computer is actively processing data.
    - It does not process off of the Hard-drive even though that is generally where everything is stored. It is loaded onto the RAM, processed accordingly, and then sent to the CPU for distribution to software, hardware, etc. 

    8 Gb (Gigabytes) | 8192 MB (Megabytes) | 8,388,608 KB (Kilobytes) | 8,589,934,592 B (Bytes) | 68719476736 b (bits)

    0 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 - Binary

    2**n = number of decimals that can be stored

How does this relate back to Numpy?
    When assigning a number to x, x = 5, it is taking 10x more bits to store this information than it "should". The reason is because Python is a high level OOPL that stores information in attributes.

    Numpy allows you to store exactly the bits needed for the number and no more.
